This results in potential buyers forming a first impression and driving past without even giving you a chance to show how perfect your client’s homes could be for them.
Face it: Even the best used homes need a little outside maintenance if we hope to attract a qualified buyer.
The good news is that 520 Property Management specializes in,
*Curb appeal                                                                                                         *Interior junk removal                                                                                            *Foreclosure cleanout                                                                                                                                      *Full lawn care service
You have just improved your chances? It is very important that the client perceives the home they may buy in a positive manner. You only have one chance to make a good first impression. The first impression a client has of a home will set the tone for the sales process. I realize the importance of this as I’m sure you do. There are many lawn care/foreclosure companies available for you to do business with today. How do you choose one? That is a question only you can answer. Some aspects you may want to consider are price, quality of work, customer service and reliability. We represent all those aspects and would like to provide our services to you. Our services are inexpensive and can be one of the best returns on your time and investment. We are a fully insured company and we hope that we have the opportunity to provide you and your clients we excellent service.
Thank you,

I'm writing to apply for an opportunity to work with your company. I am confident that my knowledge, skills and experience are well-aligned with many roles within your company; and therefore I’d be an excellent fit and asset for your organization. 

Although my resume does not included lawn & maintenance care, I have extensive experience working with my Step-dad who owned and operated a landscaping business many years ago; where I help him with mowing lawns (using a riding mower), raking levees, weed whacking (with a weed whacker), and planting flowers/gardening.  I also grew up on a farm for most of my childhood, so I also have experienced driving tractors and combines.   

For the past 5 years I’ve been educating myself with training materials regarding, “Online marketing,” while building an online business and securing vital online relationships. 

My former experience working as a supervisor, manager and/or business owner revolved around retail sales and/or self branding marketing and promotions, which allowed me to hone in on my business skills. I believe my knowledge and skills in business management and advertising would be an asset to your company.    

I’ve enclosed my resume for your consideration. Please feel free to contact me via phone or email at a time of your convenience to discuss my background and the requirements for the position.  

Sincerely, 
Antonio Trofeo

Last year  i quite doing forecloses because I was getting so many residential and commercial  properties because people like how i was doing the forecloses. I took contracts away from big companies, because the owners like the jobs I was doing with the foreclosures. Then this year a lot of this houses I took care of are under foreclosure an others having money problems.  I have decide that I want to do foreclosures again, i will not be doing private homes again because I lost so much when I did. Since 2002 I have been doing this off and on, and got hooked doing foreclosures because they are fun to do. I do have these two keys already 33535 and 23323 for the foreclosure homes.","Lawn Maintanence","Janitorial","Preservation","","1003","2013-08-26 18:06:44","http://risingsunos.com/careers-2/","","","","","","Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/29.0.1547.57 Safari/537.36","108.82.247.17"

My name is Alex Khojainov, I'm interested in your property preservation position.

I have 4 years experience working for a general contractor in Wheaton, MD.  I have experience in light plumbing and electrical, tiling, hardwood floor and floating floor installation, as well as framing, trim work, installing doors and windows, roof repair and installing new roofs.

Prior to that, I worked at a True Value hardware store in New Jersey for 5 years selling building supplies and custom paint to residential consumers and construction professionals.  During my time there, I picked up handyman gigs for customers that included painting, light plumbing and electrical, flooring and trim work.

I have a 1500 Chevy Truck and a wide variety of power and hand tools including a miter saw, compressors, trim guns and framing gun, jigsaw, sawzall, and drills.  Additionally, I have a generator, leaf blowers and lawn mowers available for the job.

Please give me a call at 202.713.1708 to discuss.  I'm available to start immediately.

Thanks,

Alex Khojainov

  My name is Garrett Gilman and I own Bay & Beach Landscaping. We are a small company but very dependable and trying hard to make a quality name for ourselves. Always looking to take on more work. We have brand new equipment paid for, current insurance, and reliable transportation. We are able to charge less than larger companies at this point in time because our overhead is very inexpensive.  Willing to expand for the right opportunities. I am a retired Marine and I only hire trustworthy individuals, most with military backgrounds. My telephone number is 321-544-8544 and our areas we cover are Dorchester, talbot, wicomico, Caroline, and Queen Anne counties, but once again willing to travel/expand for the right opportunity.

Sincerely,
Garrett Gilman

I am currently working in Newark as a Construction Director Engineer of Building and Grounds.  
 
I have a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from UCSB (California).

 I've been in the Construction business approximately for the last 18 years. I started working at a military base in California. 

Thereafter, I switched to the Construction Industry which I find to be more fascinating and hands-on supervisory and non-supervisory.

I am qualified to do management, supervisory, drawing review, engineering, estimate preparation, employee and subcontractor communication, meeting deadlines and in addition to all the facets that make a project go smoothly from beginning to completion.

My experience of Construction has involved schools, retail, commercial, homes/ units (inclusive of high-end, rental, inner city-owned). Additionally, some were ground-up and some were remodeling. 
Additionally, in the past my family owned a complex of apartment near San Jose, CA, (by Stanford) so I received years of Construction experience.
 
I'm self-motivated, work-driven and can train the right person to do the task.

Past experiences included everything to be under my scope – HVAC, Boiler, Electrical, Plumbing, Alarm systems, prints, preventive maintenance, permits and subcontractors. (i.e. anything that was needed to run and facility without complaints)
 
I also carry Construction and Real Estate licenses from various states. (CA, MA, NJ)

I also have OSHA certification.

I look forward to hearing from you.  (Please keep this confidential).

Just curious,  do you pay for relocation benefits?  We are seeking to relocate.

Best Regards,

Ed Kalman 973-246-5223

Free pick-up of appliances in any (complete) condition..  I pay (nominally) for HVAC units such as condensers, package (roof) units and air handlers (furnace/evaporator).  Dishwashers and gas ranges are excluded unless they accompany other appliances.  I can also pick-up gathered refuse for hauling to the dump for a fee; which depends on distance, typically $20/30 = dump fee.

I have experience in Lawn  care as I worked as a foreman for an apartment complex in De. We Started off hiring a company to Take care of the grounds for us until I figured out that buying our own equipment and doing it  ourselves was a lot cheaper and made more sense. I did all the maintenance for them as well. I am a carpenter by trade but I have 3 kids and a mortgage to pay so I learned not to be picky. Like I said I am a very hard worker I am smart I finish what I start and I show up to work. I was also a foreman in the city for local 608 carpenters union I had to get my osha 10 and several other safety and skill based certifications. Maybe it helps maybe it doesn't  but I am willing to work and given the opportunity I intend on making myself an asset. Thank you in advance for your time
I can be reached at 973-810-6614 if need be please leave a voice mail as I get horrible reception where I live

Some patients have experienced long-term homelessness, extreme substance abuse, contracted HIV/Aids which has lead to the severity of their mental illness. I worked with a mental health team that included psychiatrists, psychologists, registered nurses, therapist and social workers. My job was to help patients bathe, dress, and eat. I escorted patients to examinations, treatments, therapy, and recreation. I was responsible for following up with ISP’s and other written plans/goals for patients. I spent a great deal of time socializing with patients and kept them engaged in activities such as, playing cards or games, watched television with them, or lead group outings. Recorded daily observations on patient behavior and for some patients charted progress and used the reward system that was in place. I assisted the team in psychiatric emergencies, attended trainings and team meetings. I was responsible for managing interns and volunteer staff.

As an employee at Target my tasks varied throughout the store. My main tasks were, ringing on the register when backup was needed, pushing out caf-pulls from the stock room onto the sales floor to be sold, keeping the sales floor clean and safe for the customers to have a friendly shopping experience, and Sunday morning adsets. I briefly did planograms as well.

As an employee at H&M, my tasks include answering the phones to

outside callers, morning shipments which include a bill of landing and

the register and keeping the sales floor cleaned.
